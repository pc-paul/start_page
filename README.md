Start page for browsers - html table with pics

This is just a simple html table which I use as a start page. I'm really just using it to play about with git and github.

All the images are either:

- from Wikimedia Commons
- from Chelsea FC, of which I am a member
- from the Studio Theater Salisbury, 
- taken by me

The next commit will credit the Wikimedia stuff properly
